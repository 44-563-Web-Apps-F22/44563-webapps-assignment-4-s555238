               When all night long a chap remains
          On sentry-go, to chase monotony
         He exercises of his brains,
          That is, assuming that he's got any.
          Though never nurtured in the lap
          Of luxury, yet I admonish you,
          I am an intellectual chap,
          And think of things that would astonish you.
         I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!
         How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!
         That every boy and every gal
         That's born into the world alive
         Is either a little Liberal
          Or else a little Conservative!
          Fal, lal, la!</p><br>
       <p><h4> When in that House M.P.'s divide,
                                        If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,
                                   They've got to leave that brain outside,
                                        And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.
                                   But then the prospect of a lot
                                        Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,
                                   All thinking for themselves, is what
                                        No man can face with equanimity.
                                             Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!
                                             That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!
                                                  That every boy and every gal
                                                       That's born into the world alive
                                                  Is either a little Liberal
                                                       Or else a little Conservative!
                                                                      Fal lal la!<br>
            CHORUS OF FAIRIES.Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
            Carries every Bill he chooses.
            To his measures all assent—
                 Showing that fairies have their uses.
                      Whigs and Tories
                      Dim their glories,
            Giving an ear to all his stories—
            Lords and Commons are both in the blues!
            Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!
                 Shake in their shoes!
                 Shake in their shoes!
            Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!<br>
          LORD MOUNT.      Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
          Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!<br>
          Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
          Running a-muck of all abuses.
     His unqualified assent
          Somehow nobody now refuses.
               Whigs and Tories
               Dim their glories,
     Giving an ear to all his stories
     Carrying every Bill he may wish:
     Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
          Kettle of fish!
          Kettle of fish!
     Here's a pretty kettle of fish!</p></h4><br>
         <p> <h4>LEI</h4> Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!<br>
      <h4>LOR</h4>      The deuce it is!<br>
        <h4>CEL</h4> You seem annoyed.<br>
       <h4>LOR</h4>  Annoyed!  I should think so!  Why, this
  ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
  To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
  open to Competitive Examination!<br>
       <h4>LOR</h4>  And he'll carry it, too!<br>
       <h4>LOR</h4>  Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
  Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!<br>
       <h4>LEI</h4> Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!
       <h4>LOR</h4>  The deuce it is!<br>
       <h4>CEI</h4>  Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
  just as he wishes them to.<br>
       <h4>LEI</h4>  It's our system.  It shortens the debates.<br>
       <h4>LOR</h4>  Well, but think what it all means.  I don't so
  much mind for myself, but with a House of Peers with no
  grandfathers worth mentioning, the country must go to the dogs!<br>
       <h4>LEI</h4> I suppose it must!<br>
       <h4>LOR</h4> I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
  a great respect for brains—I often wish I had some myself—but
  with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,
  what's to become of the House of Commons?

          CELIA.    You seem annoyed.<br>
          LORD MOUNT.      Annoyed!  I should think so!  Why, this
          ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
          To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
          open to Competitive Examination!<br>
          LORD TOLL.       And he'll carry it, too!<br>
          LORD MOUNT.      Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
          Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!<br>
           LEILA.      Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!<br>
        LORD MOUNT.    The deuce it is!

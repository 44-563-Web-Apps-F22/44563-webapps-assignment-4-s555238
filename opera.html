           <p style="color:brown"> Scene.—Palace Yard, Westminster.  Westminster Hall, L.  Clock
            tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight.
          <br>
          When all night long a chap remains
          On sentry-go, to chase monotony
         He exercises of his brains,
          That is, assuming that he's got any.
          Though never nurtured in the lap
          Of luxury, yet I admonish you,
          I am an intellectual chap,
          And think of things that would astonish you.
         I often think it's comical—Fal, lal, la!
         How Nature always does contrive—Fal, lal, la!
         That every boy and every gal
         That's born into the world alive
         Is either a little Liberal
          Or else a little Conservative!
          Fal, lal, la!<br>
        When in that House M.P.'s divide,
                                        If they've a brain and cerebellum, too,
                                   They've got to leave that brain outside,
                                        And vote just as their leaders tell 'em to.
                                   But then the prospect of a lot
                                        Of dull M. P.'s in close proximity,
                                   All thinking for themselves, is what
                                        No man can face with equanimity.
                                             Then let's rejoice with loud Fal la—Fal lal la!
                                             That Nature always does contrive—Fal lal la!
                                                  That every boy and every gal
                                                       That's born into the world alive
                                                  Is either a little Liberal
                                                       Or else a little Conservative!
                                                                      Fal lal la!<br>
            CHORUS OF FAIRIES.Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
            Carries every Bill he chooses.
            To his measures all assent—
                 Showing that fairies have their uses.
                      Whigs and Tories
                      Dim their glories,
            Giving an ear to all his stories—
            Lords and Commons are both in the blues!
            Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!
                 Shake in their shoes!
                 Shake in their shoes!
            Strephon makes them shake in their shoes!<br>
          LORD MOUNT.      Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
          Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!<br>
          Strephon's a Member of Parliament!
          Running a-muck of all abuses.
     His unqualified assent
          Somehow nobody now refuses.
               Whigs and Tories
               Dim their glories,
     Giving an ear to all his stories
     Carrying every Bill he may wish:
     Here's a pretty kettle of fish!
          Kettle of fish!
          Kettle of fish!
     Here's a pretty kettle of fish!<br>
           LEILA.      Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!<br>
        LORD MOUNT.    The deuce it is!

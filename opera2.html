        <p> <h4>CEL</h4>  We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!
            <h4>LEI </h4> We are not all as tough as you are!
            <h4>QUE. </h4> Tough!  Do you suppose that I am insensible to the
effect of manly beauty?  Look at that man!  <p>(Referring to Sentry)</p>.
A perfect picture! <p> (To Sentry) </p>. Who are you, sir?
<h4>WIL</h4><p> (coming to "attention")</p>.  Private Willis, B Company,
1st Grenadier Guards.
<h4>QUE.</h4> You're a very fine fellow, sir.
<h4>WIL.</h4> I am generally admired.
<h4>LOR</h4> So we are.  At least I am.
       <h4>LOR</h4>  So am I.
       <h4>LOR</h4> No, no!
       <h4>LOR</h4>I am indeed.  Very plain.
       <h4>LOR</h4>  Well, wellâ€”perhaps you are.
       <h4>PHY</h4>There's really nothing to choose between you.  If one
  of you would forgo his title, and distribute his estates among his
  Irish tenantry, why, then, I should then see a reason for accepting
  the other.</p>
